# SVM
Firstly data is preprocessed then linear and RBF SVM model is built on the data.
Here diagnose is response variable, i.e. we classify based on feature variables whether diagnose methos is 'M' or 'B'.
Next we visualize the decision boundary by using 2D data. Then hyperparameter tuning is used to improve model performance.
Another method to improve model performance i.e. cross validation is used.
